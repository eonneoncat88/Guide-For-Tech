# How To Go On A Tech Adventure

This is a book to help to teach some skills that me and other past tech leads think are useful. Along the way, there will be recomendations and resources given, but I'm not all knowing so there might be a better way out there. If there is something better please make a pull request or use the google group linked later to tell me to update it
