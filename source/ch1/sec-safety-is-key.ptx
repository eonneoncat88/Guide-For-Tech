  <title>Safety Is Key</title>

  <introduction>  
    Something that we like to say in tech is that safety is key. This is for a variety of 
    reasons including the fact that being in tech exsposes you to higher risk factors from
    the tools to paint fumes to rigging you have to use. Although following all safety 
    procautions may seem irritating, it is esscential that everyone follows these guidelines
    in order to avoid possible short term and long term dentrimates to your health.

    <title>Best Practices</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        The most important of the safety procedures boil down to a few very simple ideas that 
        come from trying to not do stupid things. These are how the basic principles of wearing
        hard toed shoes, wearing safety goggles, not wearing jewelry, and pulling back long hair
        come from. Then for cirtain tasks, further procaution is needed. For example if working
        you are working with something that makes any kind of dust or aerosol you need to wear a 
        KN95 mask. Or if you are soldering electronics, you should be in a well ventilated place 
        with an ESD (electro static dicharge) strap. If you think rationally, these ideas make 
        sense.

      <p>
        However, not all safty practices are as self evadent, or even if they are, people somehow
        don't seem to remeber how to follow them until something goes wrong. It is important to 
        be conginizant of this fact in order to help reduce chances of accidents. Broadly speaking
        there are 7 categories of hazards that create these less evident safety practices. They 
        are falling hazards, slipping/tripping hazards, breathing hazards, electrical hazards, tool 
        hazards, storage hazards, and sound hazards. Each one of these hazards if can't be prevented 
        can at least be mitigated ether with best practices, or the right safety equipement.

    <subsubsection xml:id="subsec-falling-hazards">
      <title>Falling Hazards</title>
      <p>
        A falling hazard can come from a variety of sources. These include, but are not limited to
        improper rigging, unsecured dementinal or structoral materials in storage, or improperly
        framed stage pieces. Most falling hazards can be prevented with proper precaution. For 
        example, making sure to succure and balence any items in storage. Any time that rigging is 
        done, have a secondary oppion before it the rigging is actual done. While in the design
        phase of stage pieces, make sure that the factor of saftey is high enought that unecpected
        failure is unlikely. Simply being smart and intential about storage and design can generally
        midigate falling hazard risks

    <subsubsection xml:id="subsec-tripping-slipping-hazards">
      <title>Tripping/Slipping Hazards</title>
      <p>
        Tripping and slipping hazards mostly come from when people don't put away and clean up 
        there stuff, or not being intential about cable placement. If the advice from 
        <xref ref="ch-always-cleaning">Always Cleaning: Ch </xref>
        is followed, most tripping and slipping hazards will be mitigated. Additionally, if and when 
        cabels and rigging are laid out, making sure people are aware that they are on a designated 
        floor area with ground cables will help prevent tripping. With extention cords, making 
        them be under cable gaurds or better yet not used, prevents almost all other tipes of 
        tripping hazards.

    <subsubsection xml:id="subsec-breathing-hazards">
      <title>Breathing Hazards</title>
      <p>
        Breathing hazards come from many sources, such as saw dust, paint fumes, aerosol sprays,
        smoke, and more. All breathing hazards can be mitigated with some kind of resperator. However, 
        the most common reperators needed for work in the shop are disscussed in section
        <xref ref="subsubsec-respirators" text="custom">1.1.2.3 Respirators</xref>
        and will using a KN95 filter be good enough. However having a supply of higher rated filters
        on hand such as KN99 and KN100 filters is good for certain process. For example, cutting carbon
        fiber. Any time you are cutting a matterial that produces any dust or particular, you must wear 
        a mask. If there is fumes, you must wear a mask. If you do all that, you should mitagte any 
        expected breathing hazards.
      </p>
    </subsubsection>

    <subsubsection xml:id="subsec-electrical-hazards">
      <title>Electrical Hazards</title>
      <p>
        Any major electrical hazards about your facility should be described by your head tech. Generally
        speaking, avoid touching high voltage, avoid mixing liquid and electic stuff, and avoid using 
        extention cables when possible.

      </p>
    </subsubsection>

    <subsubsection xml:id="subsec-tool-hazards">
      <title>Tool Hazards</title>
      <p>
        The number of different hazards from different kinds of tools are too many to name. They can cause
        lacerations, ring avulsions, hearing damage, broken bones, pneumoconiosis, and much much more. The
        best way to midigate tool hazards, are to be properly trained in how to use a tools, and standard risk
        and risk mitigation techniques for using said tool. This can include using a push sticks, using a
        reperator, laser eye protection goggles, and other saftey equipment. A given tool should require
        cirtain safety equipment before operatoin. If proper tool training and procidures are followed,
        the risk should be mitigated. 
      </p>

    <subsubsection xml:id="subsec-storage-hazards">
      <title>Storage Hazards</title>
      <p>
        Not all materials are stable. Depending on if a material is or is not stable in storage, special
        considerations must be followed. For example, spray paint can exploit while in storage and oxygen 
        and acetylene must be seperated to help prevent spontaneous explotion case of a gase leak. These
        problems from unstable storage are mitigated by using proper storage following the safe data sheet
        of a given material.  
      </p>
    </subsubsection>

    <subsubsection xml:id="subsec-sound-hazards">
      <title>Sound Hazards</title>
      <p>
        Sound hazards are generally from using tools. Prolonged exposuer to loud noices causes hearing damage.
        To preven this using the hearing protection described in section 
        <xref ref="subsubsec-hearing-protection" text="custom">1.1.2.5 Hearing Protection</xref>
        in generally good enough. However, you should you an appropriately rated grade of sound protection
        depending on the relative noise levels in the room. In other words, whatever will be the loudest is 
        what you should worry about, not nessisarryily from the tool you are using.
