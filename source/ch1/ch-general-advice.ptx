  <title>General Advice</title>

  <introduction>
    <p> 
      Before getting into the weeds of tech, there is some important stuff we need to take about 
      and get out of the way. This includes stuff like taking about general expectations, 
      <xref ref="sec-safety-is-key">safety</xref>, emergancy procidures, and how starting a new 
      show goes. This chapter is not all encompacing and is a bit long for what you might think 
      it is, but please do read through this chapter if nothing else.
