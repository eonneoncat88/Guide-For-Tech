  <title>Safety Equipment</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      There are many kinds of safety equipment that are out there, but some are far more likely
      to need to be used for theatre shop and show production than others. The following are 
      sections are on several types of safty equpiment that will likely need to be used. However
      this list is not all encompicening, and you should recive both proper safety traing and 
      proper saftey equipment training before using any tool, machine, or piece of equipment 
      in the shop or theatre.

    <p>
      Nitrile gloves are used when handeling materials such as adhesives, paints, or machine oils 
      that you should avoid skin contact with, but need to be dispossible. Gerenally speaking, they
      are for good handeling for solvents, oils, greases, and some acids and bases. Additionally, 
      it is generally easy to see when tears and breaks will ocurr unless the gloves are compremissed 
      by materials such as acetone. Additioanlly, nitrile is useful because it prevents possible 
      latex allergies and prevides an alernative for people with latex alergies. There should always
      be a supply of them avilble to use if needed, and a box of them should also kept in the first 
      aid go bag for people trained in first aid to use.

    <p>
      There are a very large number of types of gloves that you should be aware of aside from 
      nitrile. These other types of gloves depend on use case, but this section will give a brief
      summary what we'll descride as work gloves. The 6 categories we'll briefly look at are cotton 
      or linen gloves, leather gloves, rigger's gloves, heat-resistant gloves, electrical insulated 
      gloves, and cut-resistant gloves. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Cotton or linen gloves are lightweight gloves provide basic hand protection and are can be 
      used for general-purpose tasks like handling props or costumes if you don't want to get 
      fingerprints or oils on them. They are breathable and allow for good dexterity, but won't 
      allow for much protection. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Leather gloves offer durability and protection against abrasions, cuts, and punctures. A good 
      pair are sturdy, provide good grip, and last a long time. They should be used for heavy lifting, 
      rigging tasks involving ropes and cables, handling rough materials such as OSB or raw wood. 
      Overall they are a solid pair of gloves most people in a shop should have, but tend to limit 
      dexterity and don't provide impact resitance. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Rigger's gloves are specifically designed for rigging work, and offer protection against 
      abrasions, cuts, and impact. They have reinforced palms and fingers for added protection, and 
      generally have wrist support and are often flame-resistant. They are good climbing rigging 
      structures, handling cables or ropes, and using setting up rigging equipment for lights. However, 
      they serverly limit dexterity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Heat-resistant gloves are only or tasks involving hot materials or equipment. They are essential 
      to protect against burns and made from specialized materials that can withstand high temperatures.
      They are good for handling hot stage lights, pyrotechnics, welding, and other high-temperature 
      tasks. However, they limit dextarity and are not abrasion resistant or designed to have impact 
      resistantance. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Electrical insulated gloves are designed to protect against electrical shocks. They are essential 
      for working with electrical equipment. They work by having a high electrical resistance to prevent 
      shocks. They should be used when handling electrical cables, connecting lighting fixtures, or when 
      working on electrical circuits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cut-resistant gloves protection against sharp objects, such as chisels or box cutters. They improve
      safety for tasks involving sharp materials or tools, such as when cutting and handling sharp 
      materials or working with cables and wires. However, they tend to be not be breathable and 
      come in limited sizing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each of these types of gloves is usful in its own way. However there isn't a one size fits all 
      solution for what each of these types of gloves helps with. If you are havving to buy your own pair 
      personnaly, without having a list of recomendations from the theatre orginization you are working 
      at, I would recommend against just buying a pair of generic "standard work gloves". Instead 
      consider a good pair of gloves because they will last, or at least first looking into the brand
      you consider buying. I've seen people buy bad work gloves kind that have ripoed quickly and 
      litterally fallen apart from a single thread getting caught on a raw 2x4.

    <p>
      There are two main kinds of reperators, one of which you will have to use. They are filtering 
      facepiece respirators (FFR) and elastomeric half mask respirators (EHMR). Both can accomplish
      the same task depending on the filtering rating and having an approriate fit. The primary 
      advantage of using FFRs is that they have a low intial cost, but are single use. The primary
      advantage of using EHMRs is that that they are reusable, provided cleaning and disinfecting 
      between use. The total cost per filter is also generally lower. However, EHMRs have a higher 
      up-front cost. Whether using a FFR or EHMR they should always be worn when painting in low
      ventialated spaces, working in dust filled enviorments, cutting materials, or working with foam.

    <p>
      There are two types of safty glasses, those that fit over regular glasses and those that don't.
      Safety glasses should be worn at all times! As soon as you can put your pair on, do so. It
      doesn't mater if you are using a machine or "just in the shop", they must be worn. A chip from 
      a machine someone else is working on could fly into your eye. Even if you are mostly staying on
      stage, keep them on. You never full know what might happen. There should always be a few 
      sanitized extra pairs avaible at all times for potential visors.

    <p>
      There are ear plugs and earmuff. If you are using loud equipment or in a loud zone, hearing 
      protection must be worn. In part because of this ear protection you must be intentional
      in your actions as to not accidently frigten someone using a machine or tool. There should
      always be extra hearing protection avaible. If you like ear plugs, I might recommend 
      investing in a pair of reussable ones, instead of using standard disposibles.

    <p>
      You should have a pair of steel toe shoes that you put on any time before enering the shop.
      They help proect your feet against heavy objects, falling objects, and doors. They also 
      exsist to be your shoes that get abbused by sparks and the occational acidential paint. I
      personally recomend a pair of black leather steel boots, because if you have to get rid of
      paint or they get scratched, just use some more black leather conditioner and they look 
      just fine.

    <p>
      You should hopefully never have to use a fire extinguisher, but things can and do go wrong. It is
      important to know what kind of fire extinguisher you need at a moments notice. A class A:B:C fire
      extinguisher should be aviilavalible that should be able to handle the expected fires encountered
      in a shop. Always aim at the bottom of the flame, not the tops of the flame.
