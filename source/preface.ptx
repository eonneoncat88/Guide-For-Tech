    So. . . to the fools in tech or just interested, I give you my piece de resistance. 
    This book was writen with the intent to teach you on how to m̶a̶y̶b̶e̶  survive your time 
    to come in tech. This book is without a doubt a crash course and has had 5 variations 
    of it written. With the oldest sections having been originally written for TJHS's theatre
    program. So, read everything in it with a grain of salt (as you should for everything in 
    life or theatre tech). Before we go further, there are two questions you should start 
    asking yourself. The first being to decide if you are willing commit tech. Depending on 
    who is running tech and the size of your crew it might be easier or much harder to not 
    feel overwelmed at times. The second question you can ask only really anwser once you 
    find yourself getting ready for a show and running the grind. Do you need more or less 
    That is all work then you currently have. I might recommend turning back while you still 
    can if your are a normie. However, if you stick with it, you'll come to both love and 
    hate it.

    Anyway, the purpose of this book is to teach you some skills that me and other past 
    tech members think are useful. Along the way, there will be recomendations and resources
    given, but I'm not all knowing so there might be a better ways to learn out there. If there 
    is something better please make a pull request or use the google group linked later to get 
    me to update it.
