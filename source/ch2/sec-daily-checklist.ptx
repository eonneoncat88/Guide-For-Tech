      the day if you can help finish these simple tasks it will mean you will do less cleaning days 
      and make it easier for everyone trying to find something. These tasks are what I like to call 
      wrap up procedures. Everyone should finish wrapping up what they are working on about 10-20 
      minutes before leaving in order to help out with them. Here is not all inclusive list of 
      everything that should be done:
