  <title>Cleaning is Important</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      Cleaning is the arguable most important part of staying safe during a production. Although, 
      at the end of the day you almost always want to leave as soon as possible, taking the time 
      to clean up and put things away is the best thing to do. I have 3 official reasons, but 
      honestly it doesn't take much time and the shop won't have to look like the mess in the 
      images here.

    <p>
      When you put things away were they belong, it makes it easier to find them later. It's 
      just that simple.

    <p>
      Leaving things out and about everywhere becomes a safety hazard. If not put away the cords 
      of power tools become tripping devices, and anything with a blade could cut and injure 
      someone. Or a piece of 2x4 could fall over htting someone in the head. Also, if things
      aren't put away, power tool batteries have a habit of dissapearing.

    <p>
      If you don't put things away it is well within the scope of disimplary action of tech head 
      to tell people not doing work, goofing off, or just for not helping regularly clean, to continue 
      cleaning the shop until it is clean, become a tempurary cleaner for other people, or just be 
      removed from tech.
