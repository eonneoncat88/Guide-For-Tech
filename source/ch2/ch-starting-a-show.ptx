  <title>Starting A Show</title>

  <introduction>
    <p> 
      Ah, the beginning of everything. A new show. Whether a seasoned tech veteran 
      or brand new tech (with the being your first show), it is always an experience you 
      will remember. Also, if you are not one of the head or lead techs, your job is pretty 
      easy at the beginning. All you have to do is follow the guides in this chapter and
      you'll do just fine.
