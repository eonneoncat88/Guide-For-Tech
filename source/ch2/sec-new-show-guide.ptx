  <title>New Show Guide</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      Before diving into the dirt and mud, I think it's a good idea to have a rough outline of how the 
      begining of a show goes. After read the checklist, you can look through a more depth explination 
      of each step.

      <title> Step 1 </title>
      <p>
        The invterview is really simple. You will be asked 3 main types of questions. The first being
        about what you why you are interested in tech. The second being what kinds of tools you have
        at least some experience using and what they were used for. The final is generally a question
        about relivant experiences you may have, giving you a chance to talk mostly about whatever you
        think might be relivant that you haven't said yet. For example, maybe you have done tech before
        with another group, or have relatives that talked you into joining. Anyway, this invertivew is 
        mostly a formality unless anything unusual comes up.

      <p>
        If anything comes up like sever weather, or an unexpected event like someone dropping the fire
        curtain, there needs to be a way to inform you that no one is doing work today. Also, there may
        be a need for extra build days if a project runs behind schedule and informing peopleabout these
        days is important. The form mentioned is also your contract to work on a given show. It is kept 
        kept for record as proof that you have agreeded to working under tech. It has a set of rules you
        are expected to follow on theme and about potential consiquensis if rules are disreguarded.

      <p>
        Every shop and theatre is unique in some way or another. Whether the location of the shop, the
        costum shop location, what kind of catwalks and grids there are, or the standard spot light 
        locations, you should know at least generally where it all is. During these walkthroughs you 
        should pay attention about saftey requiments that you have to follow in different areas. You
        will get training on the machines and tools you will use, but some areas have different saftey
        requiments than others. For example, you must allways wear saftey glasses in the shop. These 
        safety requirements are paramount above all else.

      <title> Step 4 </title>
      <p>
        If everything is being done well, the head tech should already have a list from having talked 
        with the director and having done listen throughs of actors rehersing. However, they are just
        a single person that might not be experience in making everything that might be needed or 
        wanted. So this list being created during this read through is to come up with things that
        are artually possible and might have been missed so far. Even if you are new to tech, feedback
        during this phase is useful because it helps contextualize what you know, and listening in will
        help you understand what is important to think about with these decisions.

      <title> Step 5 </title>
      <p>
        Some show elements are more improtant to finish first then others, and as such making a list to 
        figure out the completion order helps keep a show on track. For example, say there is a large 
        stage wagon with doors on it that actors need to use. This is more important to finish then 
        getting a soda bottle or fake flowers to act as stage decorations. By comparing different pieces
        you can get a priotorty lift fot the essential show pieces. However, there is a set of stuff
        I call the nice to haves. These are extra stage pieces or props that aren't actually needed, but
        if used can make the show better. For example, having a few extra beat up stoops if running a 
        show like Little Shop of Horrors can make skid row feel more like skid row(if that makes sense).

    <subsubsection xml:id="subsubsec-show-list-step-6">
      <title> Step 6 </title>
      <p>
        Now that there is a list of what needs to get done, figuring out who is in charge of what 
        project is the next step. Some people are better and more skilled at some types of theatre tech
        stuff then others. Deciding who is the lead tech for each project is based on a combination of
        the their skill and making sure that they aren't being overworked. For example, personally I 
        am better prop work and set builds then scenary builds. Therefore I while helping run Spamalot,
        I tended to be run projects like the french castle and a few of the swords as needed.

    <subsubsection xml:id="subsubsec-show-list-step-7">
      <title> Step 7 </title>
      <p>
        Now that every project should have a lead tech, it is time to distribute the other techs to 
        various projects. However, any new techs are unlikely to have much experiecne or know exsactly 
        what they would like to do. To help with this, each of the new techs should enter a rotation of
        apprentecing under all the standard types of projects for the first half of the shows production
        period. Then about half way through they should be perminatly assigned to the kinds of projects
        they like if possible to learn more of the needed skills.

    <subsubsection xml:id="subsubsec-show-list-step-8">
      <title> Step 8 </title>
      <p>
        After going through everything up to this point, there should already be a informal order to
        what projects should be completed in what order and what projects can be run in parralel. 
        However, formalizing this into a list helps with the next step, and helps with being able to
        see if maybe someone had been assigned to too many prjects for them to handle.

    <subsubsection xml:id="subsubsec-show-list-step-9">
      <title> Step 9 </title>
      <p>
        These dates are improtant. If a project is falling behind and won't be making the 
        expected dates, then the head tech can try to get more hours to work on a project. 
        Also, the head tech by moving people from a team that is ahead of schedule to one
        that is falling behind to help midigate the time slips. However, if there isn't a
        set of dates, then the project can slip enough that it might not be done till show 
        night. I'm speaking here from experince where a stage piece needed to have the safety
        hand rail replaced about a week before opening night.
