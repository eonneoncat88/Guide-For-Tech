  <title>Cleaning Days</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      Every once in a while you will have to have a cleaning day. This tends to happen when 
      one to many things hasn't been put away and if nothing is done it will turn into a complete 
      mess. When a cleaning day does come you don't always have to spend a full day or even 
      days cleaning if you can get these "simple" things all done. If you can it's probably good 
      enough for you to get back to work on whatever project you are working on.
